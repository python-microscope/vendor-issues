This is an empty repository only used to track vendor issues.

Microscope hardware and their software have issues.  There is no
public list of them which makes it difficult to reference them when
writing code to work around them.  We use the issue tracker for this
empty repository to document the issues of devices/software supported
by the Python-Microscope project.

If you open an issue here, also report it to the vendor.  If the
vendor has a private issue tracker (they often do), include its number
on the comment.  Add replies received from the vendor.  Only close the
issue when the vendor has released a version with the fix (and note
the version number that fixed it).
